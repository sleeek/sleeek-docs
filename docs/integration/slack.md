After connecting your Slack, you can enjoy:

## Setup Procedure

1. Connecting to Slack can done by 
- going through the initial setup process
- accessing the dashboard setup page

The initial setup screen when you first log into Sleeek will show a set of panels. You will need to select one of the 'Connect to Tools' button associated with Slack, after which you will be taken to a page to connect to tools.

If you have already connected some tools and want to connect to Slack, you will need to go to the dashboard settings page on the left sidebar and click on dashboard, and then select 'Slack' on the dashboard you choose. This will then take you to the Slack connection process.
