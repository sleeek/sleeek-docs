Sleeek displays information about individuals and teams by first recognizing which accounts from various tools belong to each team member. Sleeek automatically recognizes which accounts are connected, but it may need manual tweaking at times. 


1. Upon opening the name merge screen, Sleeek will have automatically grouped user accounts by team member based on common or similar emails/names/usernames etc. as shown. Verify its grouping.

2. Accounts incorrectly merged, or not included, can be manually modified. You can drag and drop accounts, or detach users from groupings.

3. Also, a display name for Sleeek may be selected/edited for each individual. Please edit the Display name as needed.
