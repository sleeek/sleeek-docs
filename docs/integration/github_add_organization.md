## Add a new organization

If you would like to add an additional organization from GitHub which is not installed into Sleeek Panel, you can add the organization as follows: 

> In the current version (Beta 6), a dashboard can be only linked with one GitHub organization.

If you wish to link multiple organizations in GitHub, you need to create multiple dashboard which works as same as organizations in GitHub. After log into [Sleeek.io] (app.sleeek.io) Click "Dashboard Setting" on the bottom left corner of the Dashboard screen.

Then, click the GitHub Logo in the Dashboard Name row.

Click ‘Install the Sleeek App on other Organization’ in the screen below.

> If another GitHub organization member has already installed Sleeek in the GitHub organization you want to link to, you can select in Select Org.

Click ‘Install App via GitHub’. Then move to new tab, setup screen on Github side.

Click ‘Install’ button in the screen below.

> If any of your GitHub organization already has Sleeek installed, the install button may be changed to the ‘Configure’ button, but please proceed as is.

You can see organization list. Please select organization you want to install.

> Note: If Sleeek is already installed, it shows ‘Configure’ in organization.

![Add repo](../../img/docs/integration/github/add-repo2.png)

Choose repository in specific organization.

If you want to apply all, check ‘All repository’. If you want to apply any repository, check ‘Only select repository’ and select specific repository you want to apply.
Once finished, click ‘Install’ button.

This is end of the setup process for the GitHub side.
Let’s back to Sleeek and continue to setup in Sleeek.
