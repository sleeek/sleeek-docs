Sleeek connects to essential tools for a software project. The tools are categorize to following 3 groups:

- Repository management tools: Ex) GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (not supported yet)
- Issue management tools: Ex) GitHub, GitLab, Jira
- Communication tools: Ex) Slack

After a repository management tool is connected, you can integrate issue management tools and communication tools in order to visualize more insights and metrics from multiple data sources.


The current version of Sleeek (ver. 08/19/2019) has 15 panels. Please see the right figure with the details of what you can see with each connected tool.
