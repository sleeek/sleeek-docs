Welcome to the Sleeek documentation. Sleeek is a remote management automation tool that consolidates that information from all the tools you use to give you unique insights about your team and your projectâ€™s overall health. Our sleeek-bot closes the awareness gap between project managers and their dev teams by providing thoughtful data and asking questions.
