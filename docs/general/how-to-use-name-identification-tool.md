Display name in each connected tool is sometimes different each even if it’s the same person. For example, in a merge request comment, you may use a nickname or mistype your account name.


1. First of all, just click a check box of one Display name. Then, the system suggests who may be the “same” person with a yellow highlight.

3. Please click “Merge here” of the Display name that you want to show in the Sleeek.
