Below are short videos that explain what each panel does.

## Team Velocity Panel

This is the team velocity panel which shows the velocity of a team over multiple sprints, and is created from your api connection to Jira. 

Velocity is one of the most important metrics for an Agile team, and is used to evaluate the relative performance of your team over time. 

This panel charts the planned number of story points at the beginning of a sprint next to the actual number of story points completed, as well as the individual breakdown. It also gives the average number of the story points completed over the given period. You can also click on the individual names at the bottom to remove or add them from the chart for a more customized view.

## Issue Tracker Panel

This is the issue tracker panel which shows the activity level for a given task or issue, and is created from your API connections to Jira or GitLab and GitHub's project tracking feature, as well as your code repository. 

In this example for issue SP 1161 which is already closed, 2 comments were made in Jira, and in the code repo, 209 lines of code were added, 78 lines were copied, and 15 lines were deleted, and you can see how the activity level compares to other issues. 

This can be shown for multiple milestones or sprints which you can switch to up here, and issues of lesser activity level can be seen down here.

## Project Burndown Panel

This is the project burndown chart panel, that shows the burndown rate against the daily target guideline. This is created through an API connection to your issue management system, most likely Jira. 

If you hover over it, it will select the closest oints so that you can see the exact figures, and if you click on the guideline or progress at the bottom, it will add or remove the lines. You may notice that the guideline  is not moving over the weekend. 

You can also select a different milestone or sprint by going to the dropdown above to see how your burndown changes over different sprints. 

## Time Elapsed Since Last Push Panel

This is the time elapsed since last push panel, which shows the number of days that have elapsed since an individual pushed in their code repository, and is created through your API connection to your repo. Frequent and incremental pushes are expected particularly in Agile teams, where not pushing for an extended period can be problematic. In this example, it shows that Steve pushed 14 days ago, David 11 days ago, and so on, which may be an issue for certain teams. 

## PR/PR Status Overview
[![PR/PR Status Overview Panel Video - Click To Play](http://img.youtube.com/vi/c2_SpnbT5m4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2_SpnbT5m4 "PR/PR Status Overview Panel Video - Click To Play")

This is the pull request or merge request status overview panel, that provides a visual of when pull requests are opened and closed, along with comments and interactions associated with them. This is created through an API connection to your github or gitlab accounts.

For example, here is a pull request sleeek-demo 833 that was opened by Alex, to do with updating a notification center feature, opened on March 17th. Now if we move to the side here, and look at the pull request comments, you'll see that Alex has put in the original description of what has been added, but then also asks Tedd a question, followed by a reply from Tedd, and you can track the comments in Git without leaving Sleeek. 

Now going back to this pull request, the obvious thing to notice here is that this pull request hasn't been closed, and it appears to have been forgotton, possibly to do with some miscommunication based on the comments exchanged, and perhaps calls for some manegerial action.

Another thing to note here is that if you need to access the page on github or gitlab to do with this pull request, you can always click on the links here on left, and a separate tab will open for you.
