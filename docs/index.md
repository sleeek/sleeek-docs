Sleeek, integrated with GitHub, JIRA and Slack is smarter code and team management solution that assists managers to manage their projects smoothly, with suggest and alert functions.


## What is Sleeek

Sleeek is a product that collects/processes data that is unevenly distributed among various tools used in software development projects. It makes autonomous suggestions to engineer managers about which team member may need a follow up and which code segments might cause issues in their projects.

Data that Sleeek collects/processes is visualized in Sleeek panels; The Sleeek AI bot ‘Shep’ also provides suggestions to software engineering managers.

## The function of Sleeek

There are two basic functions that Sleeek differentiates itself with. The first one is a panel group that visualizes the current status of your projects in detail from various angles. Another is an AI bot ‘Shep’ that analyzes collected information and provides suggestions to the PM (project manager). The indicators that can be visualized in the panel include the amount of code changes, the amount of code remaining in the main branch, the appearance of project members, and insights.

The AI bot ‘Shep’ presents code quality with comments on a repository management system.

### Panels:

- How much code have you created? -- Lines of code --

- Is your work still in the repo? -- Remaining rate of code --

- How’s each member doing? -- True member status --

- Has the code been reviewed by both human developers and the AI Shep? -- Comments by merge request --　　

### AI bot ‘Shep’:

- Suggestion for merge request

- Suggestion for code

- Communication with members

### Appendix:

- Dashboard customization   ...and more


Through these functions, a manager is provided with the current status of the project.
