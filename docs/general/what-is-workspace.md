## Creating/editing a Workspace

”sleeek_workspace” and “workspace_test” is submitted as Workspace name and Workspace display name (please note, only lower case alphabet, numbers, “-”, and “/” will be accepted as input for a Workspace name), then the Integration page will load, with Project View, Settings, and Workspace menus on the left sidebar.

### Settings of invited members

When the ‘Join Sleeek Now’ button from the Invitation email is clicked, the signup page for Sleeek will appear.

Since a direct user invitation is received through email, the above screen has the email prefilled and fixed, and only a password is required to complete the signup. The screen below follows. 

![Image 10](../../img/docs/general/workspace_image/image10.png)

① shows the display name associated with the Sleeek account. ②is the Workspace name of the inviter. ③is the Workspace disp name that is fixed and cannot be modified. After inputting ① and clicking the ‘Submit’ button, you will have access to a Dashboard of the Workspace of the inviter. 

#### For users who already have a Sleeek account
Once a user with an existing Sleeek account is invited into a Workspace, the SignIn page can be accessed through the Invitation email. A new Workspace is added through the following page.

#### For users who belong to multiple Workspaces
Once a user that already belongs to multiple Workspaces is invited to another Workspace, the SignIn page can be accessed through the Invitation email. A new Workspace is added through the following page.
 
![Image 9](../../img/docs/general/workspace_image/image9.png)

Here, the user can decide whether to join the Workspace they were invited to, as they may already belong to that Workspace.
#### For Sleeek accounts that do not belong to a Workspace
Users that signed up for a Sleeek account without invitation, or have been removed from an existing Workspace, will be redirected to the below screen. The user may create their own Workspace.
