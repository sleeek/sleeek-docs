Below are short videos that explain what each panel does.

## Team Velocity Panel

This is the team velocity panel which shows the velocity of a team over multiple sprints, and is created from your api connection to Jira. 

Velocity is one of the most important metrics for an Agile team, and is used to evaluate the relative performance of your team over time. 

This panel charts the planned number of story points at the beginning of a sprint next to the actual number of story points completed, as well as the individual breakdown. It also gives the average number of the story points completed over the given period. You can also click on the individual names at the bottom to remove or add them from the chart for a more customized view.

## Issue Tracker Panel

This is the issue tracker panel which shows the activity level for a given task or issue, and is created from your API connections to Jira or GitLab and GitHub's project tracking feature, as well as your code repository. 

In this example for issue SP 1161 which is already closed, 2 comments were made in Jira, and in the code repo, 209 lines of code were added, 78 lines were copied, and 15 lines were deleted, and you can see how the activity level compares to other issues. 

This can be shown for multiple milestones or sprints, and issues of lesser activity level can be seen as well.

## Project Burndown Panel

This is the project burndown chart panel, that shows the burndown rate against the daily target guideline. This is created through an API connection to your issue management system, most likely Jira. 

If you hover over it, it will select the closest oints so that you can see the exact figures, and if you click on the guideline or progress at the bottom, it will add or remove the lines. You may notice that the guideline  is not moving over the weekend. 

You can also select a different milestone or sprint by going to the dropdown above to see how your burndown changes over different sprints. 

## Time Elapsed Since Last Push Panel

This is the time elapsed since last push panel, which shows the number of days that have elapsed since an individual pushed in their code repository, and is created through your API connection to your repo. Frequent and incremental pushes are expected particularly in Agile teams, where not pushing for an extended period can be problematic. In this example, it shows that Steve pushed 14 days ago, David 11 days ago, and so on, which may be an issue for certain teams. 

## PR/PR Status Overview

This is the pull request or merge request status overview panel, that provides a visual of when pull requests are opened and closed, along with comments and interactions associated with them. This is created through an API connection to your github or gitlab accounts.

## Task Description Fidelity

This is the task description fidelity panel, which shows potential risk in your task descriptions, and is created from your API connections to Jira or GitLab and GitHub's project tracking feature. 

Here you will see a scatter plot, which plots the number of characters used in the description of the task, against the number of story points it corresponds to. 

## Notification Center
[![Notification Center Panel Video - Click To Play](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZLfKgAy-Pj4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLfKgAy-Pj4 "Notification Center Panel Video - Click To Play")

This is the notification center, which provides a list of potential risks that may require a manager's attention. It is a compilation of possible problems picked up from other panels based on your API connections to Jira, Github, Gitlab, or Slack.

## Code Contribution Over Time

This is the code contribution over time panel, that provides a visual of the lines of code produced in a team. This is created through an API connection to your code repositories. 

While lines of code isn't considered a valuable measure on its own, its aggregation over an extended period of time can reveal trends such as team fatigue or change in development phase.
