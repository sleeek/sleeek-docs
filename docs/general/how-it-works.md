Sleeek is a data aggregation solution for engineering managers that converts available data into digestible stories that they can act on. It interprets various metrics and communication data and provides useful information for the project manager that normally takes much time.
Sleeek uses API connections to JIRA, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc., along with user sentiment data collected through Slack, and displays the information as summarized text and visual charts. 

There are 3 categories of tools that Sleeek interprets:
- Repository management tools: e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (not supported yet)
- Issue management tools: e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Jira
- Communication tools: e.g. Slack

To get comprehensive information and actionable steps from Sleeek, users will need to connect Sleeek to their repository management and issue management tool as well as Slack. The current version of Sleeek will analyze source code, issue management, and user behavior to provide insights based on various metrics. Below are some of the metrics panels that give visual representations of data by tool category.
