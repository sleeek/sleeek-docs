Display names in each connected tool may be different due to the use of a nickname or misspelling/mistype of your account names even if it’s the same person.


1. When the name merge screen appears, select a display name. Then, the system suggests other user names that may belong to the same person by highlighting in yellow.<br>As an example, we selected “hiroko3” below and the system suggested “hiroko.ozaki” and “hiroko3” as the same person as “hiroko 3” in yellow highlights.
