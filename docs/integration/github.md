To give you more insightful information and actionable suggestions, you can connect your GitHub to Sleek. We analyze source code information along with your issue management as well as feedback from your team members to provide comprehensive input for your team. 

Sleeek only has “READ PERMISSION” of your repository as well as we ensure your data is safe ([learn more about our security](https://sleeekbeta2019.squarespace.com/security)).

## Setup Procedure

Click GitHub icon in a project you’d like to get comprehensive help from Sleeek.

6. Select the appropriate repository in your organization. If you want to apply all, check ‘All repository’. If you want to apply any repository, check ‘Only select repository’.  Once finished, click ‘Install’ button.


7. This is the end of the setup process for connecting GitHub. Sleeek’s analysis program starts running in order to create panels in the project view. IT takes at least several minutes depending on the data size of your repository. 


## Add a new organization

If you would like to add a new organization which is not installed into Sleeek yet, you need to proceed with the following process.


> In the current version, the dashboard is not able to link with multiple GitHub organizations.  

If your dashboard has already linked with another GitHub organization, you will not be able to connect. If you want to monitor your GitHub organization which is already linked with Sleeek, create a new dashboard and link that GitHub organization.
Click ‘Dashboard Setting’ on the bottom left corner of the Dashboard screen.

![Add new org](../../img/docs/integration/github/add-new-org.png)

Then, click the GitHub Logo in the Dashboard Name row. 

![Add new org](../../img/docs/integration/github/add-new-org2.png)

Click ‘Install the Sleeek App on other Organization’ in the screen below.

> If another GitHub organization member has already installed Sleeek in the GitHub organization you want to link to, you can select in Select Org.

Click ‘Install’ button in the screen below.

You can see organization list. Please select organization you want to install.

> Note: If Sleeek is already installed, it shows ‘Configure’ in organization.

If you want to apply all, check ‘All repository’. If you want to apply any repository, check ‘Only select repository’ and select specific repository you want to apply.
Once finished, click ‘Install’ button.
